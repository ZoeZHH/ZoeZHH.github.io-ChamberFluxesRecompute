	abstract = {Northern peatlands store a large amount of carbon and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Owing to the presence of waterlogged and anaerobic conditions, peatlands are typically a source of methane (CH(4)), a very potent greenhouse gas. This paper reviews the key mechanisms of peatland CH(4) production, consumption and transport and the major environmental and biotic controls on peatland CH(4) emissions. The advantages and disadvantages of micrometeorological and chamber methods in measuring CH(4) fluxes from northern peatlands are also discussed. The magnitude of CH(4) flux varies considerably among peatland types (bogs and fens) and microtopographic locations (hummocks and hollows). Some anthropogenic activities including forestry, peat harvesting and industrial emission of sulphur dioxide can cause a reduction in CH(4) release from northern peatlands. Further research should be conducted to investigate the influence of plant growth forms on CH(4) flux from northern peatlands, determine the water table threshold at which plant production in peatlands enhances CH(4) release, and quantify peatland CH(4) exchange at plant community level with a higher temporal resolution using automatic chambers.},

	abstract = {The eddy covariance technique ascertains the exchange rate of CO2 across the interface between the atmosphere and a plant canopy by measuring the covariance between fluctuations in vertical wind velocity and CO2 mixing ratio. Two decades ago, the method was employed to study CO2 exchange of agricultural crops under ideal conditions during short field campaigns. During the past decade the eddy covariance method has emerged as an important tool for evaluating fluxes of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over the course of a year, and more. At present, the method is being applied in a nearly continuous mode to study carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange at over a hundred and eighty field sites, worldwide. The objective of this review is to assess the eddy covariance method as it is being applied by the global change community on increasingly longer time scales and over less than ideal surfaces. The eddy covariance method is most accurate when the atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature, humidity, CO2 ) are steady, the underlying vegetation is homogeneous and it is situated on flat terrain for an extended distance upwind. When the eddy covariance method is applied over natural and complex landscapes or during atmospheric conditions that vary with time, the quantification of CO2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere must include measurements of atmospheric storage, flux divergence and advection. Averaging CO2 flux measurements over long periods (days to year) reduces random sampling error to relatively small values. Unfortunately, data gaps are inevitable when constructing long data records. Data gaps are generally filled with values produced from statistical and empirical models to produce daily and annual sums of CO2 exchange. Filling data gaps with empirical estimates do not introduce significant bias errors because the empirical algorithms are derived from large statistical populations. On the other hand, flux measurement errors can be biased at night when winds are light and intermittent. Nighttime bias errors tend to produce an underestimate in the measurement of ecosystem respiration. Despite the sources of errors associated with long-term eddy flux measurements, many investigators are producing defensible estimates of annual carbon exchange. When measurements come from nearly ideal sites the error bound on the net annual exchange of CO2 is less than +/-50 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additional confidence in long-term measurements is growing because investigators are producing values of net ecosystem productivity that are converging with independent values produced by measuring changes in biomass and soil carbon, as long as the biomass inventory studies are conducted over multiple years.},

	abstract = {Global warming, as a result of an increase in the mean temperature of the planet, might lead to catastrophic events for humanity. This temperature increase is mainly the result of an increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration. Water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the most important GHG, and human activities, such as industry, livestock and agriculture, contribute to the production of these gases. Methane, at an atmospheric concentration of 1.7 μmol mol−1 currently, is responsible for 16\% of the global warming due to its relatively high global warming potential. Soils play an important role in the CH4 cycle as methanotrophy (oxidation of CH4) and methanogenesis (production of CH4) take place in them. Understanding methanogenesis and methanotrophy is essential to establish new agriculture techniques and industrial processes that contribute to a better balance of GHG. The current knowledge of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soils, anaerobic CH4 oxidation and methanotrophy in extreme environments is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Recent projections of climatic change have focused a great deal of scientific and public attention on patterns of carbon (C) cycling as well as its controls, particularly the factors that determine whether an ecosystem is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Net ecosystem production (NEP), a central concept in C-cycling research, has been used by scientists to represent two different concepts. We propose that NEP be restricted to just one of its two original definitions—the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We further propose that a new term—net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)—be applied to the net rate of C accumulation in (or loss from [negative sign]) ecosystems. Net ecosystem carbon balance differs from NEP when C fluxes other than C fixation and respiration occur, or when inorganic C enters or leaves in dissolved form. These fluxes include the leaching loss or lateral transfer of C from the ecosystem; the emission of volatile organic C, methane, and carbon monoxide; and the release of soot and CO2 from fire. Carbon fluxes in addition to NEP are particularly important determinants of NECB over long time scales. However, even over short time scales, they are important in ecosystems such as streams, estuaries, wetlands, and cities. Recent technological advances have led to a diversity of approaches to the measurement of C fluxes at different temporal and spatial scales. These approaches frequently capture different components of NEP or NECB and can therefore be compared across scales only by carefully specifying the fluxes included in the measurements. By explicitly identifying the fluxes that comprise NECB and other components of the C cycle, such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome production (NBP), we can provide a less ambiguous framework for understanding and communicating recent changes in the global C cycle.},

Observed fluxes followed a regular diurnal cycle, peaking at midday and returning to values near zero during the night, with occasional uptake observed. CO fluxes correlated well with the meteorological variables of solar radiation, soil temperature and soil moisture content. Using a general additive model (GAM) we were able to gap fill CO fluxes and estimate annual fluxes of 0.38 ± 0.046 and 0.35 ± 0.045 g C m−2 y−1g C m−2 y−1 for 2016 and 2017, respectively.

In this study, the fluxes of 46 ions corresponding to 36 BVOCs were continuously monitored along with the exchanges of mass (carbon dioxide and water vapor) and energy (sensible and latent heat) for an entire year in a poplar (Populus) short-rotation crop (SRC), using the eddy covariance methodology. BVOC emissions mainly consisted of isoprene, acetic acid, and methanol. Total net BVOC emissions were 19.20 kg C ha−1 yr−1, which represented 0.63\% of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), resulting from −23.59 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 fixed as CO2 and 20.55 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 respired as CO2 from the ecosystem. Isoprene emissions represented 0.293\% of NEE, being emitted at a ratio of 1 : 1709 mol isoprene per mol of CO2 fixed. Based on annual ecosystem-scale measurements, this study quantified for the first time that BVOC carbon emissions were lower than previously estimated in other studies (0.5–2\% of NEE) on poplar trees. Furthermore, the seasonal and diurnal emission patterns of isoprene, methanol, and other BVOCs provided a better interpretation of the relationships with ecosystem CO2 and water vapor fluxes, with air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and photosynthetic photon flux density.},

	abstract = {The growing importance of resolving ecosystem carbon budgets has resulted in more studies integrating terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes. Although recent estimates highlight the importance of inland waters in global carbon budgets, the extent to which aquatic pathways contribute to the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) of different ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a cross-ecosystem review of annual carbon budgets integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes. Large variability in the proportion of aquatic carbon offset to terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was observed, with aquatic offsets ranging from {\textless} 1\% in a boreal forest to 590\% in a freshwater marsh. The total aquatic carbon flux was positively correlated with terrestrial NEP, suggesting highly productive ecosystems will have greater aquatic carbon offsets. However, due to an order of magnitude difference in the range of terrestrial NEP ({\textasciitilde} 1000 g C m−2 y−1) compared to aquatic fluxes ({\textasciitilde} 100 g C m−2 y−1), ecosystems with small NEP’s had greater relative aquatic carbon offsets overall in their NECB’s. Northern hemisphere peatlands and forests represented 54\% of all integrated carbon budget studies collected, indicating a severe ecosystem and spatial bias. Mangroves, agricultural, and disturbed ecosystems were the most underrepresented, yet had extreme ranges in terrestrial NEP and NECB (− 638 to 1170 g C m−2 y−1). To improve our mechanistic understanding of the role of aquatic pathways in NECB’s, more site-specific integrative studies need to be undertaken across a broader range of climatic regions and ecosystem types.},

The aim of this study was to create a complete C and GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) budget for Auchencorth Moss, an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Scotland, by combining flux tower, static chamber and aquatic flux measurements from 2 consecutive years. The sink/source strength of the catchment in terms of both C and GHGs was compared to assess the relative importance of the aquatic pathway. During the study period (2007–2008) the catchment functioned as a net sink for GHGs (352 g CO2-Eq m−2 yr−1) and C (69.5 g C m−2 yr−1). The greatest flux in both the GHG and C budget was net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Terrestrial emissions of CH4 and N2O combined returned only 4\% of CO2 equivalents captured by NEE to the atmosphere, whereas evasion of GHGs from the stream surface returned 12\%. DOC represented a loss of 24\% of NEE C uptake, which if processed and evaded downstream, outside of the catchment, may lead to a significant underestimation of the actual catchment-derived GHG losses. The budgets clearly show the importance of aquatic fluxes at Auchencorth Moss and highlight the need to consider both the C and GHG budgets simultaneously.},

We found that stream DIC is governed by a variety of sources and sinks including biogenic and geogenic sources, CO2 evasion, as well as in-stream processes. Although soil respiration was the main source of DIC across all streams, a geogenic DIC influence was identified in the northernmost region. All streams were affected by various degrees of atmospheric CO2 evasion, but residual variance in δ13C-DIC also indicated a significant influence of in-stream metabolism and anaerobic processes. Due to those multiple sources and sinks, we emphasize that simply quantifying aquatic DIC fluxes will not be sufficient to characterise their role in the global C cycle.},

The early summer gradients in hydraulic head indicated a downward flux of water in the peatland, but after a persistent mid-summer dry period the gradients changed to produce an outward radial flow from the centre to the margins of the peatland. This shift in gradients corresponded to the removal of some of CH4 and CO2 dissolved in groundwater. The concentrations of dissolved CH4 and CO2 were spatially variable, with the highest observed in the centre of the peatland. In contrast, DOC concentrations were relatively constant near the centre of the peatland, and switched in the margin from being the highest during dry periods to lowest during wet periods. The changes in concentration of CH4, CO2, and DOC are a function of the seasonal patterns of production and consumption, but groundwater flow is significant in the redistribution of dissolved carbon and the spatial patterns of concentration. The calculated mass flux of dissolved carbon was significant: it was approximately 20\% of annual CO2 fixation.},
