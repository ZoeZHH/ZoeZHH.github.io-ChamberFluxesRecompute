The chamber method is a widely-recognized technique employed for quantifying soil carbon fluxes within distinct localized areas or ecosystems. Not only is it cost-effective, but it also offers high-resolution measurements at specific sites. There are primarily two methods to analyze the flux data derived from the chamber approach: gas chromatography and the use of a portable analyzer. This website provides the procedures for recomputing fluxes when utilizing a portable analyzer.

## Background Information

#### Firstly, it's important to know the requirements for chamber based measurements:

-   Flux concentration in the chamber = Flux concentration in the air

-   Soil flux haven't been disturbed

-   Pressure inside the chamber = pressure of the ambient air

-   Good mixing inside the chamber

-   Deploying the chamber has no disturbance to soil moisture, temperature and radiation balance

#### **Secondly,** let's go through the equation on calculating the flux data by employing chamber:

$FCO2 = ((\rho* Ve)/A) * dc/dt$

$\rho$ : the dry air density

$A$: the surface area covered by chamber

$Ve$: effective volume, which was assumed to be 1.1 times the geometric volume, V of the chamber

$dc/dt$: rate of change in flux concentration with time t

To accurately compute the correct flux values, it's essential to obtain the precise mixing ratio ($dc/dt$). Therefore, the following procedures will guide you on how to recompute carbon fluxes by determining the correct ($dc/dt$)â€‹.

## Procedures

1.  Download the flux analysis software that corresponds to your analyzer. As an example, I downloaded SoilFluxPro, designed by Licor, to examine data analyzed by the LI-7810 Portable Analyzer
2.  Recompute the fluxes by examining the figures that plot flux concentrations against time
    -   Set the appropriate start and end times (At least ranging from 0-50 s for 50 data points)
        -   Exponential / Linear lines should pass through \~all initial points, meeting the requirement that the flux concentration in the chamber equals the flux concentration in the air.
        -   The standard error of $dc/dt$ should be small
3.  Export the recomputed dataset and verify the values for a second recompute
    -   Plot the standard error figure with all collars for both linear and exponential data
        -   X-axis: all collars; Y-axis: standard error values
        -   Establish the appropriate threshold and recompute the fluxes for collars that exceed this threshold
4.  Decide on fluxes
    -   Compare the standard error between the linear and exponential fits. Select the fit with the lower standard error values
    -   If the differences in standard error values fall within the 5-10% range, opt for the fit with the higher flux
5.  Export your data set for further analysis

## Tips

Ultimately, we aim to determine flux values when the chamber headspace is at atmospheric concentration. Using a linear fit for measurements might underestimate the flux at ambient concentrations. An exponential curve fit, on the other hand, allows us to calculate the $dc/dt$ at time 0, which corresponds to when the chamber concentration matches the atmospheric concentration. As such, you might find that the exponential curve fit offers a more accurate interpretation most of the time!
