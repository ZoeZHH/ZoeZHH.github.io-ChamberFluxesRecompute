The chamber method is a widely-recognized technique employed for quantifying soil carbon fluxes within distinct localized areas or ecosystems. Not only is it cost-effective, but it also offers high-resolution measurements at specific sites. There are primarily two methods to analyze the flux data derived from the chamber approach: gas chromatography and the use of a portable analyzer. This website provides the procedures for flux estimation when utilizing a portable analyzer.

The linear regression is commonly used to estimate GHG fluxes, which tends to underestimate the pre-deployment flux. A non-linearity is expected when gas concentration increases inside a closed chamber (lateral flow/leakage may also contribute), but have tendency to overestimate some flux measurements, due to it exaggerated curvature. If we aim at reducing bias on flux estimates, we should combine a linear with a nonlinear method depending on the properties of each single flux measurement with a data set.The following procedures provide you guidelines on deciding which method is more appropriate for each flux estimate.

The following procedures list provide you a guideline of "manual screening" on recomputing data by using Soilflux pro software. If you want to obtain high quality flux estimates directly without extensive knowledge by using raw data files, please try the GoFluxYourself package (https://github.com/Qepanna/GoFluxYourself) developed by Karelle Rheault.

## Background Information

#### Firstly, it's important to know the requirements for chamber based measurements:

-   Flux concentration in the chamber = Flux concentration in the air

-   Soil flux haven't been disturbed

-   Pressure inside the chamber = pressure of the ambient air

-   Good mixing inside the chamber

-   Deploying the chamber has no disturbance to soil moisture, temperature and radiation balance

#### Secondly, let's go through the equation on calculating the flux data by employing chamber:

$FCO2 = ((\rho* Ve)/A) * dc/dt$

$\rho$ : the dry air density

$A$: the surface area covered by chamber

$Ve$: effective volume, which was assumed to be 1.1 times the geometric volume, V of the chamber

$dc/dt$: rate of change in flux concentration with time t

To accurately compute the correct flux values, it's essential to obtain the precise mixing ratio ($dc/dt$). Therefore, the following procedures will guide you on how to recompute carbon fluxes by determining the correct ($dc/dt$)​.

#### Thirdly, goals for optimized flux estimation rule [@hüppi2018]:

1.  Minimize the bias from given nonlinear shaped flux
2.  Minimize the uncertainty of the flux estimate
3.  Avoid arbitrary threshold (subjective opinion)
4.  Optimal decision scheme should be simple
5.  The threshold parameters should based on statistical principles

## Procedures

1.  Download the flux analysis software that corresponds to your analyzer. As an example, I downloaded SoilFluxPro, designed by Licor, to examine data analyzed by the LI-7810 Portable Analyzer
2.  Recompute the fluxes by examining the figures that plot flux concentrations against time
    -   Set the appropriate start and end times (At least ranging from 0-50 s for 50 data points)
        -   Exponential / Linear lines should pass through \~all initial points, meeting the requirement that the flux concentration in the chamber equals the flux concentration in the air.
        -   The standard error of $dc/dt$ should be small
3.  Export the recomputed dataset and verify the values for a second recompute
    -   Plot the standard error figure with all collars for both linear and exponential data
        -   X-axis: collar number; Y-axis: standard error values
        -   Establish the appropriate threshold and recompute the fluxes for collars that exceed this threshold
4.  Decide on fluxes
    -   Compare the standard error between the linear and exponential fits. Select the fit with the lower standard error values
    -   If the differences in standard error values fall within the 5-10% range, opt for the fit with the higher flux
5.  Export your data set for further analysis

## Tips

Ultimately, we aim to determine flux values when the chamber headspace is at atmospheric concentration. Using a linear fit for measurements might underestimate the flux at ambient concentrations. An exponential curve fit, on the other hand, allows us to calculate the $dc/dt$ at time 0, which corresponds to when the chamber concentration matches the atmospheric concentration. As such, you might find that the exponential curve fit offers a more accurate interpretation most of the time!
